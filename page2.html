    <p>Here you will find I'm a lot like pluto. Not quite a planet, but still very interesting</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>1.	For this program to run it requires two people.</li>
        <li>2.	To begin stand up in an upright form and face your partner at a distance of 5 meter.</li>
        <li>3.	Once facing each other, partner A, you will approach partner B in a steady “walking pace”.</li>
        <li>4.	At 1 meter, partner A will extend their right arm while continuing to approach partner B. Aiming for just above partner b’s shoulder and with its head leaning towards the left.</li>
        <li>5.	Once a foot is between partners chests, partner A will tilt forearm to a slow rest in the middle of partner b’s back.</li>
        <li>6.	Partner A must then lean head in aiming over Partner B’s left cheek. Partner B must follow along with a 30 degree tilt of head.</li>
        <li>7.	Partner A then presses his right cheek on partner B’s left cheek. While both imitate the act of a kiss.</li>
