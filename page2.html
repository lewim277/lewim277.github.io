        <ol>
        <li>For this program to run it requires two people.</li>
        <li>To begin stand up in an upright form and face your partner at a distance of 5 meter.</li>
        <li>Once facing each other, partner A, you will approach partner B in a steady “walking pace”.</li>
        <li>At 1 meter, partner A will extend their right arm while continuing to approach partner B. Aiming for just above partner b’s shoulder and with its head leaning towards the left.</li>
        <li>Once a foot is between partners chests, partner A will tilt forearm to a slow rest in the middle of partner b’s back.</li>
        <li>Partner A must then lean head in aiming over Partner B’s left cheek. Partner B must follow along with a 30 degree tilt of head.</li>
        <li>Partner A then presses his right cheek on partner B’s left cheek. While both imitate the act of a kiss.</li>
